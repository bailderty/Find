According to [Bjarne] Stroustrup: "the name signifies the evolutionary
nature of the changes from C". This name is credited to Rick Mascitti
When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he
from C's "++" operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a
program. A joke goes that the name itself has a bug: due to the use of
post-increment, which increments the value of the variable but evaluates
to the unincremented value, C++ is no better than C, and the pre-increment
During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as
"new C", then "C with Classes", before acquiring its final name.
